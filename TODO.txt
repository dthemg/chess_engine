Step 1:
    Get started with this model. If this don't work we will train against Stockfish

Things to do:
    Training set must consist of only one team right
    For a first step, all moves made by white are correct? Disregard who wins in the end

Data augmentation: Flip the board, so that the algorithm trains on both black and white moves, that is reflect the board vertically and horizontally, as well as the labels. 

En passant? Castling rights?
